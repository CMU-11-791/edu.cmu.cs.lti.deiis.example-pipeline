Reads a Question/Answer file and generates *Question* and *Answer* annotations inside a `LIF Container <http://wiki.lappsgrid.org/org.lappsgrid.serialization/groovydoc/org/lappsgrid/serialization/lif/Container.html>`_. This implementation expects only one question and a set of candidate answers for the question.

The question should appear on the first line of the file with the candidate answers on subsequent lines::

    Q Booth shot Lincoln?
    A 1 Booth shot Lincoln.
    A 0 Lincoln shot Booth.
    ...

The question line start with the uppercase letter 'Q' followed by a single space followed by the question.  Each answer line starts with the uppercase letter 'A' followed but a 1 (one) or a 0 (zero) followed by the candidate answer.  The one is used to indicate that the candidate answers the question while a zero indicates that the candidate does not answer the question.
